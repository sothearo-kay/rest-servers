# REST API with TypeScript and Express

This project demonstrates how to build a REST API using **Express** and **TypeScript**. It covers essential REST concepts like CRUD operations, a database layer, authentication with **JWT**, and validation with **Zod**. Youâ€™ll also learn how to use **Docker** for containerization and **NestJS** for larger, more structured backend applications.

## Getting Started

This project helps you understand and build a **RESTful API** using TypeScript. Follow the instructions below to get the server running locally.

<br>

## Architecture Overview

The API follows the **REST architecture** to facilitate communication between the client and the backend server.

- **HTTP Methods:**

  - **GET** - Fetch resources
  - **POST** - Create resources
  - **PUT** - Update resources
  - **DELETE** - Delete resources

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Express:** Minimal framework for building APIs.
  - **Database Layer:** Integration with **Prisma ORM**.
  - **Authentication:** **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
  - **Validation:** **Zod** for request validation.

## Features
- TypeScript for type safety across the project.
- CRUD operations with **Express**.
- Authentication with **JWT**.
- Data validation with **Zod**.
Containerized deployment using Docker.
